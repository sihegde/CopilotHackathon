# Travel Domain – Copilot Hackathon Challenge

## Description

In this challenge, you will build a **Travel Booking System** that allows travelers to search for travel options, create bookings, and view travel itineraries using the **data provided** in this repository.

The goal of this challenge is to help developers understand how to work with an existing dataset, model relationships between entities, and build application functionality using **GitHub Copilot**.


---

## Problem Statement

Travel booking platforms are widely used to plan trips involving flights and hotel stays. These platforms rely on pre‑existing data about travelers, travel options, and bookings to enable users to plan and manage their travel.

Your task is to build an application that uses the provided travel data to:

- Display available travel options
- Create and manage bookings
- Show travel itineraries for travelers

The application should simulate a simplified travel booking experience using the provided CSV files.

---

## What You Need to Build

You are expected to build a Travel Booking application that supports:

- Viewing traveler information
- Searching and viewing available flights
- Searching and viewing available hotels
- Creating travel bookings
- Viewing and managing existing bookings
- Viewing travel itineraries

You may implement this as:
- A backend application with APIs
- A web application
- A command‑line application

---

## Data Available

The travel domain data is provided under the following folder:
**challenges/travel-domain/data**

The data may include:
- Travelers
- Flights
- Hotels
- Bookings

---

## Constraints and Guidelines

- Use the provided data as‑is
- Do not introduce new core datasets
- Handle missing or invalid data gracefully
- Focus on correctness and clarity rather than advanced features
- Use **GitHub Copilot** to assist with:
  - Understanding data structures
  - Generating application logic
  - Writing boilerplate and helper code

---

## Expected Outcome

At the end of this challenge, you should have:

- A working Travel Booking application
- Functionality to manage travel bookings using CSV data
- Clear usage of GitHub Copilot during implementation
- Clean, readable, and maintainable code
