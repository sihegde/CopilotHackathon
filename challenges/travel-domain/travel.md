# ✈️ Travel Domain – Copilot Hackathon Challenge

## DESCRIPTION

The goal of this challenge is to build a **Travel Booking Management Application** using the **pre‑provided travel dataset** available in this repository.

Developers will work on designing APIs and/or user interfaces that allow users to search travel options, create bookings, and view travel itineraries.

The focus of this challenge is to understand existing data, model domain entities correctly, and use **GitHub Copilot** to accelerate application development.

## DOMAIN OVERVIEW

The Travel domain represents common travel booking workflows such as:
- Searching flights and hotels
- Booking travel for users
- Viewing and managing travel itineraries

The application should reflect realistic travel scenarios and workflows.

- Hotels
- Bookings
- Travel itineraries

Participants are expected to **use the provided data** and not create fictional core data.

- Reads and uses existing travel data
- Supports travel booking workflows
- Demonstrates effective usage of GitHub Copilot
